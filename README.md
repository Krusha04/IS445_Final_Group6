# IS445_Final_Group6
## About the project
This is our final submission for IS445 Final Project. The Jupyter notebook(ipynb file) here is the final product of the exploration of the dataset called US Visa Applications. We tried to make interactive visualizations to represent some of our findings through this work. 
### Background:
Before an employer wishes to hire an international employee, the DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Once this permanent labor certification is obtained the employer will need to seek the immigration authorization from USCIS.

### Dataset:
This data was collected and distributed by the US Department of Labor. Data covers 2011-2016 and includes information on employer, position, wage offered, job posting history, employee education and past visa history, associated lawyers, and final decision. It contains 106 columns and 371,010 rows.
